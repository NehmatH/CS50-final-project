CS50 Final Project
==================

*This is Let's Meet*

Let's Meet is a web-based application that allows users to search for users, add and remove friends and create and plan events all in one place.


How the website works
=====================

To get started, all you need to do is create an account by providing a username and a password.
Then, once you log in, head over to the "Search Users" page where you can search for your friends' usernames and send them friend requests.
Once your friends accept your requests, they'll be added to your "My friends" list where you have the option of removing them anytime you'd like.

Now, let's create your first event. Click on the "Create event" page and fill in the required information, from picking a name, location, date and time, to choosing participants from your friends list.
Once the event is created, it should appear on your "My Events" page.

Since you are the admin of the event, you get to add and remove participants, or event delete the event altogether.
Meanwhile, if you're just a memeber, you can leave the event if you don't feel like going.
